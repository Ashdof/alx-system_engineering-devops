# 0x00 Shell Basics

Introduction lesson on Linux System adminstration. In this lesson, we were introduced to the Shell, a programme that takes commads from the keyboard and gives them to the operating system to execute. Examples of such programmes are Bash (Bourne Again SHell), ksh, tcsh and zsh.

We also had hands-on practice with the terminal emulator which is a program that opens a window and lets the user interact with the shell. Examples include genome-terminal, konsole, xterm, rxvt, nxterm, and eterm.
