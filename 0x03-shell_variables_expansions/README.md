# 0x03. Shell, Init Files, Variables and Expansions
This lesson introduced us Shell Expansions which occurs when a command is expanded before the shell acts on it. Some of these expansions are pathname expansion, tilde expansaion, arithmetic expansion, brace expansion, parameter expansion etc.

We were also introduced to variables which are useful in shell scripting, as well as the shell initialization files and the alias command.
