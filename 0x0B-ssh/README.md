# 0x0B. SSH
In this lesson, we were introduced to the concept of connecting to a remote server using a secure shell. This project also enabled us to connect to a dedicated server.

# General Objectives
At the end of the lesson, we were able to:
- Describe a server
- Explain where servers usually live
- Explain sn SSH
- Describe how to create an SSH RSA key pair
- Demonstrate how to connect to a remote host using an SSH RSA key pair
- Recognize the advantage of using #!/usr/bin/env bash instead of /bin/bash
