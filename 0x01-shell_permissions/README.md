# 0x01. Shell, permissions

In the second lesson on the shell, we learned about permissions and users of the Linux system. Given the multi-user capability of the Linux system, different users can operate on the system at the same time who may be connected via secure shell (SSH).

Permissions ensures security of the system, the files and the users by enabling the setting of different permissions of a particular file to different users and groups.
