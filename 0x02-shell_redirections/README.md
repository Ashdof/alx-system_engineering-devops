# 0x02. Shell, I/O Redirections and filters

In this lesson, we learned and practised shell redirections using various commands and utilities of the shell programme. I/O Redirection involves redirecting the input and output of commands to and from files. We also learned to form complex commands by connecting multiple commands into pipelines.
